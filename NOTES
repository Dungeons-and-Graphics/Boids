This VM brings me nothing but profound, deep and unbearable PAIN. The current max speed is about 5WPM. Hopefully it will be better tommorrow.
I need to push my work more often

I have written out the structs though it is still unclear whether I should use a single or doubly linked list to keep track of the boids in each part of the screen. For now
I think a regular list willl suffice. This shouldn't take long to finish, my primary goal is to make it in 3D.
