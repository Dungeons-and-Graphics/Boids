This VM brings me nothing but profound, deep and unbearable PAIN. The current max speed is about 5WPM. Hopefully it will be better tommorrow.
I need to push my work more often

I have written out the structs though it is still unclear whether I should use a single or doubly linked list to keep track of the boids in each part of the screen. For now
I think a regular list willl suffice. This shouldn't take long to finish, my primary goal is to make it in 3D.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Didn't do much today. Waiting on new whiteboards to arrive.
Have yet to test what I wrote. I realized that the best way to split the scene into a grid (for collisions) is to have cells = # of boids / 2
I don't think I will take user input just yet.
As of now boids spawn in random locations and are assigned t thei corresping cell (the one at their origin and the ones t which they collision radius extends)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<rant> Have yet to test anything again but the VM is geting slow (again). I'm only limited by its speed >>> Can you believe it took me 30 seconds to write "int i = 0" </rant>
Made some utils function, have yet to code most of them but the math is done. Wondering what the best way to switch cells would be... Currently I'm freeing every cell and filling it again
but optimally I would like to remove a boid if it doesn't belong, and add it to its new cell.... the problem is this ends with multiple copies of the same boid in one cell...
I could check if the boid already exists within the cell but given enough boids that's not a good solution.

Tomorrow I will be able to make the first test though I expect I will have to do some SDL magic to be able to use SDL without having all of its one million and one .h files in my incl/
The test should just have boids movinf at random (on that, note that I still need to add wall bounce or at the very least teleportation >>>>)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Somehow boid->direction and boid-position.x / y can be modified and retain their value. Any variable in boid->vars however cannot be changed for some unknowreason and always goes back to 0...
I need these values to change a sthey are the one I'm using to calculate the influence of the surrounding boid on the position of te of the current void.
All movement functions work, but without these variables there is no way for me to  link them together;
