# Boids
Flocking simulation.

 - [x] Rule 1: Move away

  - [x] Rule2 : Move closer

  - [x] Rule3 : Follow


----------------------------

## TODO

  - [ ] Follow mouse

  - [ ] Avoid Obstacles

  - [ ] TUrn rules on and off
  
  - [ ] Refactor

## NOTES

At the moments, each boid is checking the position and orientation of every other boid in the simulation, altough simple this method is highly unneficent and I intend to replace it some day
in (hopefully) the close future.
